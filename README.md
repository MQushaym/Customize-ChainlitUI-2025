## üåü Project Overview

This repository hosts the **Customized User Interface (UI)** for the **AI-GRC Assistant**. The interface is built using the Python library **Chainlit** and heavily customized to deliver a clean, professional, and compliant user experience (UX).

The project adheres to a **Microservices Architecture** by operating as a lightweight frontend client. Its sole responsibility is handling user interaction, sending queries to the designated backend API, and displaying the specialized RAG responses.

## üöÄ Key Features and Customization

This project highlights advanced frontend and integration skills by adapting a standard framework to meet specific professional needs:

  * **Deep UI Customization:** Custom CSS (`stylesheet.css`) and JavaScript (`elements.js`) were implemented to align the chat interface with professional standards.
      * **Branding & Aesthetics:** Custom styling was applied to the assistant's avatar/logo (`emt.png`) and chat elements.
      * **UX Cleanup:** Unnecessary default platform elements, such as the "New Chat" button and system watermarks, were hidden using JavaScript for a distraction-free experience.
  * **Professional Configuration:** The `config.toml` file is precisely configured to manage session timeouts, specify custom assets, and control the display of advanced features.
  * **Decoupled API Integration:** The core application logic (`ui.py`) uses the `requests` library to seamlessly communicate with the external FastAPI backend, ensuring the interface remains fast and independent of the complex RAG processing.
